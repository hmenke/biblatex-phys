The biblatex-phys package provides an implementation of the 
bibliography styles of both the AIP and the APS for biblatex.
This implementation follows standard biblatex conventions, and
can be used simply by loading biblatex with the appropriate option

  \usepackage[style=phys]{biblatex}
   
A demonstration database is provided to show how to format
input for the style. Style options are provided to cover the
minor formatting variations between the AIP and APS bibliography
styles.
